## Problem Section

### Section Header
Every Minute of Silence Costs You Money

### The Stakes
- **70% of leads** who don't get a response within 3 minutes book with your competitor
- Your team can't answer phones at 2 AM—but your customers are searching then
- Website visitors leave without a trace, and you never know they existed
- Missed calls and slow email responses are bleeding your revenue dry

### Emotional Hook
You didn't start your business to lose customers to a competitor with a faster reply.

## Solution Section

### Section Header
Your 24/7 Revenue Recovery System

### Three Pillars

#### 1. Instant Inbound Response
AI agents that answer calls and triage emails the moment they arrive. No hold music. No "we'll get back to you." Just immediate, intelligent responses that book appointments and answer questions—even at 3 AM.

#### 2. Website Visitor Intelligence
We identify the anonymous visitors browsing your site and automatically reach out before they disappear. Turn "just looking" into "just booked."

#### 3. Embedded Conversion Widget
Drop our agent directly into your website. Every form submission, every chat inquiry gets an instant, personalized response that moves leads toward booking.

## How It Works Section

### Section Header
Live in 48 Hours, Not 48 Days

### Step 1: Design Your Agent
Use our Agent Creator to craft responses that sound like your best employee. Set your services, pricing, availability, and tone.

### Step 2: Connect Your Systems
We integrate directly with your existing tools—Zendesk, ServiceTitan, Jobber, HouseCall Pro, or plain email. No ripping out what works.

### Step 3: Install the Pixel
Drop one line of code on your website. We start identifying visitors and tracking intent immediately.

### Step 4: Launch Your Sequences
Set the rules for follow-up. When someone visits your pricing page twice? We reach out. Abandoned a booking form? We recover it.

## Objection Handling / FAQ Section

### Section Header
Questions We Get Asked

### Q: How hard is this to set up?
**A:** Most customers are fully live within 48 hours. We handle the technical integration—you just need to tell us how you want your agent to sound and respond. If you can fill out a form, you can launch an agent.

### Q: Is this worth it if we don't have much website traffic?
**A:** Yes—and here's why. First, you're probably getting more traffic than you realize (most service businesses don't track properly). Second, our phone and email agents work regardless of website traffic. Third, even 50 monthly visitors converting at 10% vs 2% is the difference between 5 new customers and 1.

### Q: I've seen a lot of AI tools. How is this different?
**A:** We built this because we ran a service business ourselves—we scaled Setter to $12M/year in revenue. We're not AI researchers who read about your problems in a blog post. We lived them. That means our agents are built for how service businesses actually operate: appointment-based, reputation-dependent, and time-sensitive.
